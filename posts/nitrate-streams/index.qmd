## Problem description

Healthy rivers are vital for ecosystems and human communities, but invisible pollutants such as nitrate (NO₃⁻) can silently degrade water quality.\
Nitrate mainly originates from fertiliser runoff and urban wastewater, and excessive levels lead to eutrophication—the growth of algal blooms that deplete oxygen and threaten aquatic life.

Traditional monitoring based on monthly water samples often misses rapid changes in nitrate levels after rainfall or runoff events.\
A recent study by Kermorvant et al. (2023) used high-frequency in-situ sensors to explore how nitrate concentrations vary through time and how they relate to other water-quality variables such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity.\
The goal was to identify which factors most strongly influence nitrate levels across diverse river environments.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analysis

**Data source.** Data were obtained from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) in the United States. These sensors record readings every few minutes, providing a detailed picture of short-term water-quality dynamics.

**Study sites.** Three contrasting streams were analysed:

| Site      | Location                        | Typical nitrate (µM) |
|-----------|---------------------------------|----------------------|
| Arikaree  | Colorado — semi-arid grassland  | 5.5                  |
| Caribou   | Alaska — sub-arctic forest      | 28                   |
| Lewis Run | Virginia — agricultural + urban | 192                  |

: Average nitrate across three NEON streams. {#tbl-sites}

As Table @tbl-sites shows, **Lewis Run** (farmland + towns) had nitrate almost **40×** higher than **Arikaree**, highlighting strong land-use effects.

## Findings

```{r}
#| label: fig-nitrate
#| fig-cap: "Nitrate concentrations differ strongly across sites."
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(
  Site = c("Arikaree", "Caribou", "Lewis Run"),
  Nitrate = c(5.5, 28, 192)
)
ggplot(df, aes(Site, Nitrate)) +
  geom_col() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Nitrate (µM)")
```

As Figure @fig-nitrate illustrates, nitrate levels increase from natural to agricultural catchments. Sensor data also revealed distinct event responses:

At Arikaree, nitrate spiked after rainfall, consistent with fertiliser runoff.

At Lewis Run, heavy flow diluted nitrate because rainfall added relatively clean water.

Statistical modelling identified six important predictors — temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, specific conductance, water level, and time — that together explained about 99 % of nitrate variation. Among these, specific conductance and dissolved oxygen were the most consistent indicators of nitrate change across all sites.

## Conclusion and why it matters

This research highlights how modern sensor technology transforms water-quality monitoring. Continuous, high-frequency data allow scientists and managers to detect nitrate spikes quickly and respond before serious ecological damage occurs.

Two key takeaways stand out:

Local context matters. Each catchment behaves differently; effective management must reflect local land use, climate, and hydrology.

Continuous monitoring pays off. Tracking conductivity, oxygen, and flow provides cost-efficient insights into pollution sources and ecosystem health.

Overall, the study demonstrates that combining sensor data with statistical modelling offers a powerful tool for protecting freshwater systems and informing evidence-based environmental policy.
