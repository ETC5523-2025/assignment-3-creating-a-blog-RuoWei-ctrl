I am currently studying for a **Master of Business Analytics** at **Monash University**, where I focus on data analytics, statistical modelling, and data storytelling. I enjoy exploring how data can be used to support business decisions and communicate insights effectively. My key interests include data visualization, predictive analytics, and translating complex results into practical business actions. I work mainly with **R**, **Python**, and **Quarto**, and I value clear and reproducible workflows.  

This website is part of my ETC5523 course — *Communicating with Data* — where I share projects and blog posts that combine analytics, visualization, and communication.
