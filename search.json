I enjoy exploring how data can be used to support business decisions and communicate insights effectively. My key interests include data visualization, predictive analytics, and translating complex results into practical business actions. I work mainly with R, Python, and Quarto, and I value clear and reproducible workflows.\nThis website is part of my ETC5523 course — Communicating with Data — where I share projects and blog posts that combine analytics, visualization, and communication."

    "text": "Healthy rivers are vital for ecosystems and human communities, but invisible pollutants such as nitrate (NO₃⁻) can silently degrade water quality.\nNitrate mainly originates from fertiliser runoff and urban wastewater, and excessive levels lead to eutrophication—the growth of algal blooms that deplete oxygen and threaten aquatic life.\nTraditional monitoring based on monthly water samples often misses rapid changes in nitrate levels after rainfall or runoff events.\nA recent study by Kermorvant et al. (2023) used high-frequency in-situ sensors to explore how nitrate concentrations vary through time and how they relate to other water-quality variables such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity.\nThe goal was to identify which factors most strongly influence nitrate levels across diverse river environments."

These sensors record readings every few minutes, providing a detailed picture of short-term water-quality dynamics.\nStudy sites.

Sensor data also revealed distinct event responses:\nAt Arikaree, nitrate spiked after rainfall, consistent with fertiliser runoff.\nAt Lewis Run, heavy flow diluted nitrate because rainfall added relatively clean water.\nStatistical modelling identified six important predictors — temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, specific conductance, water level, and time — that together explained about 99 % of nitrate variation. Among these, specific conductance and dissolved oxygen were the most consistent indicators of nitrate change across all sites."

    "text": "Conclusion and why it matters\nThis research highlights how modern sensor technology transforms water-quality monitoring. Continuous, high-frequency data allow scientists and managers to detect nitrate spikes quickly and respond before serious ecological damage occurs.\nTwo key takeaways stand out:\nLocal context matters. Each catchment behaves differently; effective management must reflect local land use, climate, and hydrology.\nContinuous monitoring pays off. Tracking conductivity, oxygen, and flow provides cost-efficient insights into pollution sources and ecosystem health.\nOverall, the study demonstrates that combining sensor data with statistical modelling offers a powerful tool for protecting freshwater systems and informing evidence-based environmental policy."
